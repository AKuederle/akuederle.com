      - paragraph [ref=e73]:

      - paragraph [ref=e75]:
        - text: If you read my little side-note and ran the script, you probably noticed that nothing really happened. This is, because we haven’t told matplotlib to do anything. We only initialised a figure object and assigned it to a variable (

      - paragraph [ref=e84]: If we rerun our script now, we should end up with a beautiful grey canvas in an external window. Again, check your taskbar; the figure window was probably opened in the background.

      - paragraph [ref=e107]: This part is basically identical to the “easy” way. However, we target the axes directly again. Note, that there is a slide change in the syntax (xlabel —> set_xlabel).

When entering a multi-line command (like a loop or a function), the compiler expects an indentation in the following line(s) and reads until a non-indented line is found.

      - paragraph [ref=e340]: These mathematical operators are nor limited to integer or float values, but also work with strings, lists, or boolean values (True or False). However, only objects of the same type can be compared. The “magnitude” of a string is determined by its position in the alphabet (“a”<“aa”<“b”<“ba”<“c”), while strings containing numbers are positioned before alphabetic values (“1”<“1a”<“2”<“a”). Regarding booleans, True is by convention bigger than False. Just play around with these examples a little bit to get familiar with the mechanics. As substitution for the double-equal you can just use the English “is”. This is actually the preferred way when comparing boolean values. In combination with any of these comparison operators, you can use the “not” at the beginning to reverse the statement.

Furthermore, we should consider making the print parameter optional. Most of the time it will be set to false any way (if anybody would use this kind of useless function). So, it is just annoying to type it out every damn time. To make a parameter optional, just give it a default value like so:"

      - paragraph [ref=e533]: So these are the essentials to getting started on the pure Python side of things. Of course, we barley scratched the surface, but I think it is enough for now. I want to finish up this part of the tutorial with a few words about object oriented programming. Yeah… No real practical example this time around because the post is already pretty long. But, we gonna use this opportunity and kick of the next lesson with a nice, more complex example to refresh our knowledge about everything we learned so far.
      - heading "Object oriented" [level=3] [ref=e534]
      - paragraph [ref=e535]: "As you already know, Python is heavily object oriented; everything is an object. If you want to be a efficient Python programmer you have to understand that and use it to your advantage. Because everything is an object, there is no real difference between a list, a string, a function, or even a module; they all treated as objects with their respective functions and properties. Therefore, you can take all these objects, pass them around, assign them to variables, return them as function outputs, put them in lists, and so on without changing anything about the object itself. For example, something like this works:"

      - paragraph [ref=e572]: And finally to fully get into Python’s “black magic”, create and return a function from a function. This is called a “closure”.

      - paragraph [ref=e592]:
        - emphasis [ref=e593]: Don’t worry if you don’t get it… Its not something you gonna need very often.
      - paragraph [ref=e594]:
        - text: The other important thing that derives from Python’s object orientation, is that many basic things you do, are actual function calls on an object. For example, if you are trying to get an element from a list (list[n]), no Voodoo happens, but rather the
        - emphasis [ref=e595]: __getitem__()
        - text: "-function of the list object is called. With this knowledge, you can mess around and change the fundamental behaviour of python, or enable cool things, like element calling, for custom created objects. But this is again a lesson for another day. For now, just keep in mind, everything is an object and can be passed around without loosing its properties and behaviours."
      - paragraph [ref=e596]:
        - emphasis [ref=e597]: "PS: Maybe you read through this tutorial and thought, why the hell should I need a function which can add 1 to a value, or why do I possible want to check if 12 is greater than 10? Simple answer - You don’t! These short example are meant to visualise the syntax and the basic possibilities. In a complex example it is much harder to showcase only a single basic part of Python’s capabilities. However, if you understood this basic examples, I am sure you can think of more complex and useful ones. With that said, keep on coding and learning!"
      - paragraph [ref=e598]: This is everything for today. I am sure you learned something and further I hope that I woken your interest to learn more about Python. As always, leave a comment or contact me in any other way if you have questions, critic, suggestions, or anything else.
